                                             We take many special precautions to protect the privacy of children under 18. We do not require a child to disclose more
                                            information than is reasonably necessary to use the Mobile Application and Services. Parents can review their child's information,
                                            delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of such information. Parents have an easy method for giving
                                            consent. We encourage children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any Mobile Application,
                                            including the Scelto App. We believe parents should be involved in the online activities of their children and suggest that
                                            parents do their best to provide their children with a safe and friendly online environment.
